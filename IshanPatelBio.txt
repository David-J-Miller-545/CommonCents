Hello, I am Ishan Patel. I am currently a Computer Science major planning to graduate in 2027. I am an avid programmer, and I like to use my skills to improve the technology that impacts our everyday lives. I am interested in Web Development,  but I plan to explore the field of ML/AI in the near future. Besides CS, I like to read/watch technological reviews, especially those related to smartphones and EVs.
